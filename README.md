Implementation of the [GloVe model](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) in PyTorch, using the `torch.nn` library. Created only for pedagogical purposes, so any feedback on code quality, performance enhancement etc. is highly appreciated.

#### Based on:
- [2014mchidamb's implementation](https://github.com/2014mchidamb/TorchGlove/blob/master/glove.py)
- [the test functions of Practical PyTorch](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/glove-word-vectors/glove-word-vectors.ipynb)
